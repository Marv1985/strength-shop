# Strength Shop site clone

This is one of my first projects that I made using React. It is a clone of a website I really like and use regularly. It's not as responsive as it could be but from what I learned from making such a realatively large project I'm happy with the outcome as the experience has prepared me for making fully responsive sites and using a more organised/structured approach.
